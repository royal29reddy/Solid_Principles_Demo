S- SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
--->SRP can be stated as, Class should have a single responsibility and only one reason to change.

O- OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE
---> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

L- LISKOV'S SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
---> It prescribes Substitutability of a class by its sub-class.
>Broadly, a class can be replaced by its subClass in all practical usage Scenarios i.e.
we have to create parent class in such a way so that it remains substitutable by child class.

I- INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE
---> A  client should never be forced to implement an interface that it does not use.

D- DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE
---> High level modules should not directly depend on low level modules, instead they should depend on abstraction. i.e. depends upon  abstraction/ interfaces rather than concrete classes.


>>> I have written a program to demonstrate all these principles.
